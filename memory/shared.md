## Machine Status

| Machine | OS / Environment | Key Tools | Status |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| [machine-name] | [OS, shell] | [Node, Python, Claude Code version] | [active / setup-pending] |

## Environment Notes
<!-- Cross-machine conventions worth knowing -->
<!-- e.g. "pnpm preferred over npm on all machines" -->
<!-- e.g. "Desktop has GPU — use for heavy compute, model runs, etc." -->
