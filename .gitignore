# Draft files — work-in-progress, never auto-synced
# Write new files as <name>.md.draft until structurally complete,
# then rename to <name>.md. Prevents half-written handoffs or decisions
# from being committed and broadcast to other machines on crash.

# Scratch directory — temp files, test scripts, raw API responses
# All agents must use ~/hive/scratch/ for any throwaway work.
# Never write temp files to the repo root or any tracked directory.
