## Problem

<!-- What specifically needs to be solved or reviewed? One clear paragraph. -->

## Context

<!-- Everything the receiving agent needs to understand the situation:
     - Relevant files and their locations
     - What the system is supposed to do
     - Any constraints (OS, tool versions, architecture decisions already made)
     - Links to relevant decisions in memory/decisions.md if applicable -->

## Attempted Solutions

<!-- What was already tried and why it didn't work.
     Be specific — include commands run, errors received, and reasoning.
     If nothing was attempted: "None — delegating before attempting." -->

## Required Output

<!-- Be unambiguous. Specify:
     - Exact deliverable (code change, explanation, decision, review)
     - Format expected (inline edit, new file, verbal answer)
     - Where to put it (file path, section in this document, etc.)
     If the receiving agent has to guess, rewrite this section. -->
